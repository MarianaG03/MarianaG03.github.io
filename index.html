      <p>
        This portfolio is the work of Mariana Garcia. Please do not copy any materials without permission.
        Some exhibits and work samples were created during my time as a student or intern and are the property
        of the organizations noted. These materials are included solely to demonstrate my experience and

      <h2>Purpose Statement</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of this portfolio is to showcase the skills, experience, and growth I’ve developed as a
        software developer. This includes school projects, personal work, and contributions made during
        internships. Through this portfolio, I aim to highlight my technical strengths, problem-solving
        ability, and readiness for roles in high-impact, secure development environments. I also want to
        demonstrate my commitment to learning and continuous improvement as I transition into a full-time
        software development role.

      <h2>Work Philosophy</h2>
      <p>
        I believe in staying curious, adaptable, and committed to quality. I strive to write clean, secure,
        and efficient code, and I value collaboration, open communication, and continuous improvement. I
        approach every challenge with determination and a growth mindset.
      </p>

      <h2>Career Goals</h2>
      <p>
        In the next five years, I aim to join a large, high-impact software development team—preferably in
        government, defense, or secure tech—where I can grow my expertise in backend development, security, and
        scalable systems. I also want to become a certified full-stack developer and mentor junior developers.
